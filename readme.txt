= What Mailflow can do =

Using our **unique tagging mechanism** you can apply tags to contacts at any point within a campaign and **automatically target emails based on those tags**. Actions an audience member takes directly affect the next email in the sequence they might receive.

Within your Wordpress site you can **assign tags to pages**, so whenever a logged in site member visits a tag is assigned. This means the content of the emails they receive can be directly affected by the content they have seen on site.

**Send on-boarding sequences** to new members when they sign and add them into your existing campaigns **without having to change any of your membership forms and settings**. All your transactional and marketing emails  in one place.

Mailflow allows you to **schedule your emails** so they can go out after a delay or at an exact time. You can set **different timezones** for different email sequences so you know you are sending your campaigns when people are most receptive.

With sender profiles you can **manage different campaigns for different sites** all in one place. Use the most appropriate profile for the campaign. For instance send transactional emails from “billing@yoursite.com" and your newsletter from “newsletter@yoursite.com".

View all your campaign data where it should be, see each sequence in action and every email as it’s sent. You **analytics update live** as it happens, so every open, click and delivery can be actioned.

Track clicks on **every individual link** in an email and create actions dependant on those clicks. Test buttons and messaging and see what works best. See where people click in your emails.

Through Zapier you can **integrate your payment gateway, CRM or any other of the 400+ platforms** which are supported. So send your contacts straight to salesforce or trigger email sequences from stripe payments.

Mailflow is built from the API up, so everything can be achieved with our **secure API**. If you want to build your own custom integration or use Mailflow to manage just one element of your email marketing you can with our API.

**Fully fledged support** is at the heart of Mailflow and that doesn’t stop just with how to use the platform. We will take you all the way through from how to create better subjects lines to the best sort of CTA for email. If you need **help with any aspect of your campaign** we are here to help.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How much does Mailflow cost? =

It's completely free to get started, we won\'t charge you anything until you start sending in bulk. If you have a small mailing list and only send a few emails a month you might not need to ever pay us anything.

= How long does it take to get up and running? =

When we say seconds we really mean it. You can register your account, verify your email and connect your Wordpress site really very quickly and easily.

= I'm new to email marketing, how complex is it? = 

It's as difficulty as you make it. We have structured everything to keep it as simple as possible. Someone who has never done any email marketing should be able to get their account and first email sequence set up without ever needing to look at the support material. However we advise you do as there might be a few things you didn\'t realise you *could* do.

= I'm a power user - is this suitable for me? =

Yes, yes it is. By massively simplifying how email sequences are constructed it allows you to create much more complex campaigns without the headache. You can also send as many emails as you want per month, purchasing additional credits where necessary. You can also integrate it directly into your own systems via our API.

= I don't get it - help! =

That's not a problem, just take a look at our [support material](https://mailflow.com) and get in touch from there. We really are happy to help and can guide you through everything.
